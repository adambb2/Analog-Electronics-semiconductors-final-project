# Analog-Electronics-semiconductors-final-project
This was the final design of my Analog Electronics (semiconductors) class. The project required the design of a circuit that used a transducer in a bridge circuit to along with an instrumentation amplifier and ZENER diode to produce an output voltage varying from -5V to 5V when the transducer was turned.
